While the typical code review is focused on software quality, including usability, reusability, and maintainability, secure code reviews are focused on software security aspects, including but not limited to confidentiality, integrity, and availability (C.I.A.).\nIn 2006, Howard from Microsoft, published “A Process for Performing Security Code Reviews.”. It provides some general guidelines for performing a security code review. The guidelines are still valid today:\n\nMake sure you know what you are doing\nPrioritize\nReview the code.\n\nMake sure you know what you are doing \nBefore you review code, please make sure you understand the following:\n\nThreat Model and Security Architecture of the feature, including assets, security objectives, adversaries, and the mitigations.\nThe general secure design and coding principles for EDK II.\n\nPrioritize \nAccording to “A Process for Performing Security Code Reviews.”, the priority of common software code is below:\n\nOld code\nCode that runs by default\nCode that runs in an elevated context\nAnonymously accessible code\nCode listening on a globally accessible network interface\nCode is written in C/C++/assembly language\nCode with a history of vulnerabilities\nCode that handles sensitive data\nComplex code\nCode that changes frequently\n\nExcept for items #4 and #5, all other rules apply to EDK II firmware.\nReview the code \nReviewing the code involves three steps:\n\nRerun all available code-analysis tools.\nLook for common vulnerability patterns, such as\nInteger arithmetic vulnerabilities\nBuffer-overrun vulnerabilities\nCryptographic vulnerabilities\nStructured Query Language (SQL) Injection vulnerabilities\nCross-site scripting vulnerabilities\n\n\nDig deep into risky code, such as\nAre there logic or off-by-one errors (for example, ‘>’ vs. ‘>=’ or ‘||’ vs. ‘&&’)?\nIs the data correctly validated?\nAre buffer lengths constrained correctly?\nAre integer values range-checked correctly?\nAre pointers validated?\nCan the code become inefficient (for example, O(N2)) due to some malformed data (for example, a hash table look-up becomes a list look-up)?\nAre errors handled correctly?\n\n\n\nOther than #2.iv and #2.v above, all other rules apply to EDK II firmware.\nBesides “A Process for Performing Security Code Reviews.”, Ransome provided some good suggestions in the book “Core Software Security: Security at the Source” on how to perform the SDL activity including security code review.\nEDK II Secure Coding Guidelines \nWe also provided the guideline for EDK II Secure Coding. People need to fully understand the EDK II secure coding best practices before doing the security code review.\n"},"code_review_guidelines_for_boot_firmware/":{"url":"code_review_guidelines_for_boot_firmware/","title":"Code Review Guidelines for Boot Firmware","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

Examples include:\n\nUEFI capsule image\nBoot logo in Bitmap (BMP) or Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) format\nContents of file system partitions\nRead/write variables\nSystem Management Mode (SMM) communication buffer\nNetwork packets\n\nPrevious Vulnerabilities:\nBoot Logo Image \nAt BlackHat 2009, Invisible Things Lab demonstrated how to use a buffer overflow in BMP file processing to construct an attack and flash a new firmware. The BMP file is an external input where an attacker may input a large value for PixelWidth and PixelHeight. This causes BltBufferSize to overflow and results in a very small number. This is a typical integer overflow caused by multiplication.\nEFI_STATUS ConvertBmpToGopBlt ()\n{\n /// ...\n  if (BmpHeader->CharB != 'B' || BmpHeader->CharM != 'M') {\n    return EFI_UNSUPPORTED;\n  }\n  BltBufferSize = BmpHeader->PixelWidth * BmpHeader->PixelHeight\n                    * sizeof (EFI_GRAPHICS_OUTPUT_BLT_PIXEL);\n  IsAllocated = FALSE;\n  if (*GopBlt == NULL) {\n    *GopBltSize = BltBufferSize;\n    *GopBlt = EfiLibAllocatePool (*GopBltSize);\nTo handle these cases, code should check for integer overflow using division, as shown below:\nif (BmpHeader-&gt;PixelWidth &gt; MAX_UINT / sizeof \n(EFI_GRAPHICS_OUTPUT_BLT_PIXEL) / BmpHeader-&gt;PixelHeight) {\n    return EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER;\n\n}\nSMM Callout \nAt Black Hat DC 2009, Invisible Things Lab demonstrated a way to inject code into SMM. The SMM code referenced (ACPINV below) a function pointer in Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) Non-Volatile Storage (NVS) memory and invoked this function address. An attacker may modify the function pointer address in ACPI NVS so it points to a malicious function.\nmov [ACPINV+x], %rax\ncall *0x18(%rax)\nA similar issue is also found in ThinkPad 2016. The SmmRuntimeCallHandle is the pointer in ACPI Reserved memory. As such, the attacker may replace this function pointer with any address. \nThis is shown in line with the statement:  RtServices = (EFI_SMM_RT_CALLBACK_SERVICES *) SmmRtStruct->PrivateData.SmmRuntimeCallHandle; below.\nEFI_STATUS\nEFIAPI\nSmmRuntimeManagementCallback (\n  IN EFI_HANDLE             SmmImageHandle,\n  IN OUT VOID               *CommunicationBuffer,\n  IN OUT UINTN              *SourceSize\n  )\n{\n  SMM_RUNTIME_COMMUNICATION_STRUCTURE *SmmRtStruct;\n  EFI_SMM_RT_CALLBACK_SERVICES        *RtServices;\n\n  RtServices  = NULL;\n\n  SmmRtStruct = (SMM_RUNTIME_COMMUNICATION_STRUCTURE *) CommunicationBuffer;\n  RtServices  = (EFI_SMM_RT_CALLBACK_SERVICES *) SmmRtStruct->PrivateData.SmmRuntimeCallHandle;\n\n  if (RtServices != NULL) {\n    RtServices->CallbackFunction (RtServices->Context, mSmst, (VOID *) &SmmRtStruct->PrivateData);\n    SmmRtStruct->PrivateData.SmmRuntimeCallHandle = NULL;\n  }\n\n  return EFI_SUCCESS;\n}\nIt is critical that SMM never reference memory outside System Management RAM (SMRAM) for function pointers.\nIn the latest Intel processors, the SMM_Code_Access_Chk feature can be used to block code execution outside of the value set by the SMRAM Range Register (SMRR). This feature MUST be enabled if it is supported.\nThe latest versions of EDK II also enable Executable Disable (XD) for memory addresses outside of SMRAM.\nSMM Communication \nIn CanSecWest 2015, a new class of SMM attack was disclosed. The attacker may construct a SMM \ncommunication buffer that points to memory owned by System Management RAM (SMRAM) or Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM), then pass this address into a System Management Interrupt \n(SMI) handler. This causes the SMI handler to perform the write for the attacker. This typically classified as a “confused deputy” attack. See the lines with CommBuffer \nand with the  CopyMem statement below.\nSmmVariableHandler ()\n//  ...\n  SmmVariableFunctionHeader = (SMM_VARIABLE_COMMUNICATE_HEADER *)CommBuffer;\n  switch (SmmVariableFunctionHeader->Function) {\n  case SMM_VARIABLE_FUNCTION_GET_VARIABLE:\n    SmmVariableHeader = (SMM_VARIABLE_COMMUNICATE_ACCESS_VARIABLE *)\n    SmmVariableFunctionHeader->Data;\n    Status = VariableServiceGetVariable (\n               ...\n               (UINT8 *)SmmVariableHeader->Name + SmmVariableHeader->NameSize\n               );\n}\n\nVariableServiceGetVariable (\n  // ...\n  OUT VOID *Data\n  )\n{\n // ...\n  CopyMem (Data, GetVariableDataPtr (Variable.CurrPtr), VarDataSize);\n}\nTo mitigate this attack, the SMI handler is required to use the library service SmmIsBufferOutsideSmmValid() to check the communication buffer before accessing it.\nACPI table for Authenticated Code Module (ACM) is a signed binary module delivered by Intel. It is used to construct a dynamic root of trust for measurement (DRTM) \nenvironment. In 2011, Invisible Things Lab disclosed a way to hijack the SINIT ACM. \nThe issue happens when the ACM code parses the untrusted ACPI DMA Remapping (DMAR) table. The DMAR table is used before validation of the address. As such the attacker may \ncontrol the copied memory length and override the Intel Trusted Executable Technology (TXT) heap and SINIT ACM itself. See line 6741 below.\n6675: mov  (%edi),%esi\n6677: cmpl $0x52414d44,(%esi)\n; (DWORD*)esi == ’DMAR’?\n\n667d: je 0x6697\n...\n6697: mov  (%edi),%edi\n6699: mov  %edi,%es:0xa57\n; var_a57 = &dmar\n\n66a0: mov  0x4(%edi),%ecx\n; ecx = dmar.len\n\n66a3: push %ecx\n66a4: add  %edi,%ecx\n66a6: mov  %ecx,%es:0xa5b\n; var_a5b = &dmar + dmar.len\n\n...\n6701: mov  %es:0xa47,%edi\n; edi = var_a47 (memory on the TXT heap)\n\n6708: mov  (%edi),%eax\n670a: mov  %es:0xa5b,%ebx\n; ebx = &dmar + dmar.len\n\n6711: sub %es:0xa57,%ebx\n; ebx = dmar.len\n\n...\n6738: mov %es:0xa57,%esi\n; var_a57 = &dmar\n\n673f: mov %ebx, %ecx\n6741: rep movsb %ds:(%esi),%es:(%edi)\n; memcpy (var_a47, dmar, dmar.len)\nAdding a check for the length field of untrusted data source is mandatory.\nCapsule Image \nMost UEFI firmware supports capsule based firmware update. In 2014, MITRE demonstrated how to use a vulnerability in the capsule coalesce process to attack the firmware update process.\nThis is another example of an integer overflow. NOTE: MemorySize if statement and Size += below.\nEFI_STATUS\nEFIAPI\nCapsuleDataCoalesce (\n  IN EFI_PEI_SERVICES                **PeiServices,\n  IN EFI_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS            *BlockListBuffer,\n  IN MEMORY_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR      *MemoryResource,\n  IN OUT VOID                        **MemoryBase,\n  IN OUT UINTN                       *MemorySize\n  )\n{\n  //...\n    if (*MemorySize Length;\n      Count++;\n  ...\n}\nBefore the code performs the addition, the code must use subtraction to check if the addition will cause an integer overflow.\nRead/Write Variable \nA read/write variable is another potential attack surface because it is easily controlled by an attacker. In CanSecWest 2014, MITRE demonstrated how to modify the “Setup” variable to bypass UEFI secure boot ImageVerificationPolicy.\nThe attack taught us that it is a bad idea to embed security policy in a read/write “Setup” variable.\nS3 Boot Script \nThe S3 Boot Script is used to restore the register settings during the ACPI S3 resume process. In CanSecWest 2015, Invisible Things Lab found some firmware implementations did not protect the S3 script or the dispatch function code, so it remained in an OS-accessible ACPI memory region. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious boot script content to bypass the silicon lock register setting in the S3 Boot Script.See the use of EntryFunc  and EntryPoint below.\nBootScriptExecuteDispatch (IN UINT8 *Script)\n{\n   ...\n   EntryFunc = (DISPATCH_ENTRYPOINT_FUNC) (UINTN) (ScriptDispatch.EntryPoint);\n   Status = EntryFunc (NULL, NULL);\n}\nAs a mitigation, the lockbox should be used to protect data used in the S3 resume phase.\nNetwork for AMT \nIntel® Active Management Technology (Intel® AMT) is a remote management feature in the Intel vPRO platform. In 2017, Embed disclosed an issue with Intel AMT where providing an empty response will cause password verification to succeed as if the attacker provided the admin password. \nSee the use of strncmp and response.length below.\n/* NETSTACK_CODE:20431FC8 */\n\nif(strncmp(computed_response, response.value, response.length))\n{\n   goto error;\n}\nreturn 0;\nTo avoid similar issues, network packet processing code should always be carefully reviewed.\n"},"code_review_guidelines_for_boot_firmware/race_condition.html":{"url":"code_review_guidelines_for_boot_firmware/race_condition.html","title":"Race Condition","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

If the check function verified the non-SMRAM copy of communication buffer and then uses it, the attacker may use another CPU thread to perform Time-of-Check/Time-of-Use (TOC/TOU) attack to modify the buffer content after it is checked.\nTo mitigate this, the communication buffer must be copied into SMRAM before it is checked.\nAnother example is the motherboard flash content. When Intel Boot Guard is enabled, the Authenticated Code Module (ACM) loads Initial Boot Block (IBB) flash into cache and validates the cached copy. An attacker may use the flash programmer to update the IBB flash copy after it is loaded by ACM. This is a variation of a Time-of-Check/Time-of-Use attack.\nThe IBB cache copy mechanism needs to ensure that no code or data in the IBB flash can be referenced.\nRace condition for register unlock \nIn 2014, MITRE found a race condition, named Speed Racer, which allows an attacker to subvert a component of the firmware flash protection mechanisms.\nSecure code review must verify that SMM code does not leave threads outside of SMRAM when there is flash protection is in an unlocked state.\n"},"code_review_guidelines_for_boot_firmware/hardware_input.html":{"url":"code_review_guidelines_for_boot_firmware/hardware_input.html","title":"Hardware Input","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

If an attacker controls hardware, the input from hardware is considered to be untrusted. This includes, but is not limited to, Memory Mapped Input/Output (MMIO), cache, Direct Memory Access (DMA), Universal Serial Bus (USB) descriptors, and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) advertisement data.\nPrevious Vulnerabilities:\nMMIO BAR Overlap \nIn BlackHat 2008, Invisible Things Lab demonstrated how to program the remap Base Address Register (BAR) to make the remap memory overlap with VMM or SMRAM, thus allowing for subsequent modification of the VMM or SMRAM contents.\npci_write_word (dev, TOUUD_OFFSET, (new_remap_limit+1)&lt;&lt;6);\npci_write_word (dev, REMAP_BASE_OFFSET, new_remap_base);\npci_write_word (dev, REMAP_LIMIT_OFFSET, new_remap_limit);\nIn BlackHat 2009, Invisible Tings Lab also found the remap register bar can make the remap memory overlap with Management Engine (ME) RAM, thus allowing for a modification of the contents in ME firmware.\nTo mitigate this class of attack, verify register bars are properly locked\nMMIO BAR Access \nIn RECon 2017, Intel disclosed the MMIO BAR access issue in SMM. The attacker may configure the MMIO BAR to make it overlap with SMRAM. After this, subsequent access to MMIO in SMM becomes accesses to SMRAM.\nSee statements with bar assignment within if statement below.\n\nstatic void mainboard_smi_brightness_down (void)\n{\n  u8 *bar;\n  if ((bar = (u8 *)pci_read_config32(PCI_DEV(1, 0, 0), 0x18))) {\n    printk(BIOS_DEBUG, “bar: %08X, level %02X\\n”, (unsigned int)bar,\n    *(bar+LVTMA_BL_MOD_LEVEL) &amp;= 0xf0;\n    if (*(bar+LVTMA_BL_MOD_LEVEL) &gt; 0x10)\n      *(bar+LVTMA_BL_MOD_LEVEL) -= 0x10;\n  }\n}\nThere are several ways for firmware to mitigate this class of attack. For example, SMM can verify the MMIO bar does not overlap with SMRAM or is not in DRAM before access. SMM can revert the MMIO bar value to the default setting, perform an operation, then restore it to the original value.\nCare must be taken when code checks the MMIO. In 2009, Invisible Things Lab showed an incorrect check for MMIO BAR. This code checks the Memory Controller Hub (MCH) BAR value, but only for the lower 32 bits. Since the MCH BAR is 36 bits, the attacker may configure the MCH BAR value above 4G and exploit ACM due to the error in validation. This can results in an improper setup for the Intel® Virtualization Technology for Direct I/O (Intel® VT-d) engine. \nSee the usage of MCHBAR address below\npusha\nmov eax, 0x48 ; MCHBAR address\ncall pci_get_long\nand ebx, 0xfffffffe\nmov DWORD PTR es:MCHBAR, ebx\ncmp ebx, 0xfec04000\nja continue\nmov al, 0x4\nmov ah, 0xc\ncall sinit_error\ncontinue:\nor ebx, 0x1\ncall pci_write_long\npopa\nret\nCache \nIn CanSecWest 2009, Cache poisoning was used to attack SMRAM in 2009. The attacker modifies the Memory Type Range Register (MTRR) to make it overlap with SMRAM, then updates the SMRAM cache and triggers an SMI.\nRecent Intel processors have introduced the SMRAM Range Register (SMRR) to resist cache poison attack. SMRR must be setup for all logical processors. This prevents the MTRR overlap with SMRAM from taking effect.\nDMA \nIn BlackHat 2013, the NCC group demonstrated a DMA attack using Thunderbolt. In 2017, OS password theft was demonstrated using PCIleech hardware.\nDMA attacks can be mitigated by setting up the Input/Output Management Unit (IOMMU) to block DMA access to full system memory. In firmware, this can be achieved using the IOMMU or disabling the Peripheral Component Interconnection (PCI) Bus Master Enable (BME) bit. However, if an untrusted device driver requires PCI BME access, the IOMMU must be setup to accommodate the untrusted device.\nUSB \nBecause attackers can create devices with bad USB descriptors, USB data is considered untrusted. Projects like Facedancer are good examples of USB fuzzing tools. In BlackHat 2014, a demo shows how to do fuzz for the USB device driver.\nUSB firmware drivers must assume USB descriptors are untrustworthy and always verify before consumption. This policy should also be applied to other drivers that consume potentially untrustworthy data, such as Bluetooth device advertisement messages.\nTPM Genie \nIn 2018, the NCC group demonstrated that a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) Genie may cause memory corruption in different TPM stacks, including Linux, tboot, and UEFI. This is possible when data returned by the TPM is not validated by the TPM stack.  See the usage of recd in the statements below.\nint tpm_get_random(u32 chip_num, u8 *out, size_t max) {\n  struct tpm_chip *chip;\n  struct tpm_cmd_t tpm_cmd;\n  u32 recd, num_bytes = min_t(u32, max, TPM_MAX_RNG_DATA);\n  ...\n  tpm_cmd.header.in = tpm_getrandom_header;\n  tpm_cmd.params.getrandom_in.num_bytes = cpu_to_be32(num_bytes);\n  err = tpm_transmit_cmd( chip, &amp;tpm_cmd,\n  TPM_GETRANDOM_RESULT_SIZE + num_bytes );\n  ...\n  recd = be32_to_cpu(tpm_cmd.params.getrandom_out.rng_data_len);\n  memcpy(out, tpm_cmd.params.getrandom_out.rng_data, recd);\n  ...\n}\nAs mitigation, the TPM driver must perform robust checks of the response buffer size.\n"},"code_review_guidelines_for_boot_firmware/secret_handling.html":{"url":"code_review_guidelines_for_boot_firmware/secret_handling.html","title":"Secret Handling","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

Sometimes the firmware also includes some password or access key. We need a good way to handle these secrets.\nPrevious Vulnerabilities:\nPassword not cleared in memory \nIn DefCon 2008, iViZ disclosed a way to get the password from the BIOS Data Area (BDA) because the BIOS does not clear the keyboard buffer which contains the password information.\nAfter the password is used, the code should always clear it in its various locations: input key buffer, stack, heap, global variable, etc.\nKey based protection \nIn BlackHat 2019, Mastrov disclosed how to brute force search Computrace disable key in SMRAM. The key comparison algorithm does not have a constant time. Also, the final key is only 1 byte. See the statement using key_match below.\nkey_byte = cpu_regs->EBX;\nComputraceState.Active = TRUE;\nComputraceState.DisableSecreteKey[0] = key_byte & 0xff;\nComputraceState.DisableSecreteKey[1] = (key_byte & 0xff00) >> 8;\nComputraceState.DisableSecreteKey[2] = (key_byte & 0xff0000) >> 16;\nComputraceState.DisableSecreteKey[3] = (key_byte & 0xff000000) >> 24;\n\nkey_match = TRUE;\nfor (i = 0; i This is a vulnerable inside channel attack. The duration of the verification then reveals the index of the character. The code should always use a mechanism that compares the entire data before completion. Note a single-byte key is vulnerable to brute force attack.\nDefault key \nIn BlackHat 2011, Accuvant Lab disclosed a way to access battery firmware because the access key is unchanged. The below disassembly code shows the 0x36720414 is hardcoded. It is also the default unseal key in a public document.

The firmware code needs to configure the system and lock the critical resources by setting the lock bit in a silicon register. Examples include but are not limited to flash chip lock, SMM lock, SMI lock, MMIO BAR configuration lock, Model Specific Register (MSR) configuration lock, etc.\nPrevious Vulnerabilities:\nFlash \nIn 1998, older platforms did not properly lock access to the flash parts, allowing anyone to overwrite BIOS code. Sixty million computers were believed to be infected by the CIH) virus.\nIn Power Of Community 2007, a new attack appeared which took advantage of the Intel top swap feature, if the latter capability was unlocked.\nToday, there are several ways to lock the flash part, and the firmware should lock all the possible ways, in proper time, and in all boot paths. These paths include a normal boot, S3, S4, capsule update, recovery, etc.\nSMRAM \nIt is likely the first documented SMM attack, which occurred because the SMM memory range was not locked.\nPlatforms must lock SMRAM in silicon and setup SMRR for all processors to protect SMRAM. This lock must happen in all boot paths (normal boot, S3, S4, capsule update, recovery, etc.).\nMMIO BAR \nIn BlackHat 2008, Invisible lab demonstrated how to use unlocked remap registers for SMM or Management Engine (ME) firmware to inject code.\nToday, all critical MMIO bars are required to be locked without overlap. The configuration is checked by the ACM during a TXT DRTM launch.\n"},"code_review_guidelines_for_boot_firmware/secure_configuration.html":{"url":"code_review_guidelines_for_boot_firmware/secure_configuration.html","title":"Secure Configuration","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

The general configuration also includes the system state, memory configuration, different boot mode, etc.\nPrevious Vulnerabilities:\nUEFI Secure Boot \nIn CanSecWest 2014, MITRE disclosed the vulnerability that the OEM used setup a variable to control the image verification policy. That meant the UEFI secure boot could be easily bypassed. See lines below assigning values to policy within each case statement. \nDxeImageVerificationHandler(EFI_EXECUTABLE Image) {  \n  switch (getImageOrigin(image)) {\n  case IMAGE_FROM_OPTION_ROM:\n    policy = Setup.LOAD_FROM_OROM;\n  case IMAGE_FROM_FIXED_DRIVE:\n    policy = Setup.LOAD_FROM_FIXED;\n  case IMAGE_FROM_REMOVABLE:\n    policy = Setup.LOAD_FROM_REMOVABLE;\n  ...\n  if (policy == ALWAYS_EXECUTE)\n    return EFI_SUCCESS;\n  else\n    return IsImageAllowed(image);\n}\nFor any security feature, there should be no way to bypass it in the production. No variable should be used to control it. If a Platform Configuration Database (PCD) is used, the PCD must be statically configured.\nIntel® Boot Guard \nIn 2016 and DefCon 2017, Ermolov disclosed how to bypass Intel® Boot Guard.\nIn BlackHat 2017 and BlackHat 2019, Mastrov disclosed how to bypass Intel® Boot Guard. See lines below assigning values to BootGuardVerifyTransitionPEItoDXEFlag followed by a check.\nEFI_STATUS BootGuardPei (EFI_PEI_SERVICES **PeiServices, VOID *Ppt)\n{\n  ...\n  if (!((BootGuardHashKeySegment1 == 0) {\n    CalculateSha256 (BootGuardHashKeySegment1);\n    CalculateSha256 (CurrentBootGuardHashKey1);\n    if (!MemCmp (BootGuardHashKeySegment1, CurrentBootGuardHashKey1, 32)) {\n      BootGuardVerifyTransitionPEItoDXEFlag = 1;\n    } else {\n      BootGuardVerifyTransitionPEItoDXEFlag = 0;\n      return EFI_SUCCESS;\n    }\n  }\n  return Status;\n}\n\nEFI_STATUS BootGuardDxe (EFI_HANDLE ImageHandle, EFI_SYSTEM_TABLE *SystemTable)\n{\n  ...\n  if (BootGuardVerifyTransitionPEItoDXEFlag == 0) {\n    BootGuardRegisterCallback();\n  }\n  return EFI_SUCCESS;\n}\nThe summary of the issue is below:\n\nThe Intel® Boot Guard configuration is not set properly.\nThe verification does not always happen in all boot modes. For example, the verification is done only once every 12 times a device is powered up.\nThe software logic issue in Intel Boot Guard PEI or DXE that the verification may be bypassed in some cases.\n\nThe mitigation is:\n\nFuse configuration – always verify the fuses are configured for security.\nVerification – ensure that verification occurs in all boot modes and boot paths.\n\nTCG Trusted Boot \nIn BlackHat 2018, Han disclosed an issue about TPM measurements in a DRTM environment. This issue was related to the S3 resume path, where TBOOT only measured code and read-only data for the Measured Launch Environment (MLE). However, TBOOT did not measure the required initialized data. This created a condition where an attacker could hijack the control flow and exploit TBOOT. See lines below with statements _mle_end and .data.\n  _mle_start = .;               /* beginning of MLE pages */\n    *(.text)\n    *(.fixup)\n    *(.gnu.warning)\n    } :text = 0x9090\n\n  .rodata : { *(.rodata) *(.rodata.*) }\n  . = ALIGN(4096);\n\n  _mle_end = .;                 /* end of MLE pages */\n\n  .data : {            /* Data */\n    *(.data)\n    *(.tboot_shared)\n    CONSTRUCTORS\n    }\nMitigation occurs when MLE sets up the environment, ensuring that all critical data (code, read-only data, and initialized data) is measured, including the function pointers. This demonstrates the importance of a complete measurement.\nIn BlackHat 2019, Han disclosed an issue using TPM in a static root-of-trust for measurement (SRTM) environment. During the S3 resume path, if the OS does not send Shutdown(STATE) the firmware Startup(STATE) will fail. Some platform firmware only sent Startup(CLEAR) which left all Platform Configuration Registers (PCR) open. See lines below with if statement BootMode == BOOT_ON_S3_RESUME and then Status = Tpm2Startup (TPM_SU_CLEAR); statement.\nPeimEntryMA ()\n{\n  if (BootMode == BOOT_ON_S3_RESUME) {\n    Status = Tpm2Startup (TPM_SU_STATE);\n    if (EFI_ERROR (Status) ) {\n      Status = Tpm2Startup (TPM_SU_CLEAR);\nThe mitigation extends the PCR with an EV_SEPARATOR error, which takes advantage of proper error handling.\n"},"code_review_guidelines_for_boot_firmware/replayrollback.html":{"url":"code_review_guidelines_for_boot_firmware/replayrollback.html","title":"Replay/Rollback","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

Typically, a timestamp, nonce value, or monotonic counter can be used to detect replay.\nRollback is the ability to start at a newer level of a release and go back to a forbidden earlier level of a release. Typically, the firmware needs to use a lowest support version (LSV) or secure version number (SVN) to control the update.\n"},"code_review_guidelines_for_boot_firmware/cryptography.html":{"url":"code_review_guidelines_for_boot_firmware/cryptography.html","title":"Cryptography","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

Choosing the right cryptographic algorithm is important. A checksum or CRC value is no longer considered to be strong protection. Cryptographic key management must be considered as part of a complete security solution.\nPrevious Vulnerabilities:\nIn BlackHat 2009, Chen demonstrated how to add a rootkit to Apple Keyboard firmware via a firmware update.\nIn 2010, Weinmann demonstrated how to add a rootkit to ThinkPad embedded controller (EC) firmware via update.\nIn 2011, Cui demonstrated how to add a rootkit to HP printer firmware via update.\nAll of the cases above demonstrate the need for firmware locking and authenticated updates.\n"},"code_review_guidelines_for_boot_firmware/other.html":{"url":"code_review_guidelines_for_boot_firmware/other.html","title":"Other","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

Attackers have experience in reverse engineering, making back doors easy to detect. This is especially important for code related to SMI handlers, UEFI variables, or key management.\nIn BlackHat 2018, Domas demonstrated how to find a hidden instruction to gain supervisor privileges in user mode. He used fuzzing to scan the system and found a special “God Mode Bit” (MSR 1107, BIT 0). Toggling this bit activated a launch instruction (0F03). By using a co-located core with unrestricted access to the core register file, software can send content via Ring3 to modify a Ring0 register and obtain hardware privilege escalation.\n"},"code_review_guidelines_for_boot_firmware/summary.html":{"url":"code_review_guidelines_for_boot_firmware/summary.html","title":"Summary","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
